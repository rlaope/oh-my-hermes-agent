Use this skill when the user mentions oh-my-hermes or a workflow keyword such as `ralph`, `ultragoal`, `deep-interview`, `team`, `ultraqa`, `ralplan`, or `code-review`.

## Routing Contract

This is best-effort Hermes prompt guidance. It does not override Hermes core routing and it does not claim exact runtime parity with another agent framework.

Priority:

1. Explicit slash skill invocation wins.
2. Explicit workflow keywords route to the matching adapted skill when installed.
3. Broad planning requests route to `ralplan` or `plan` before implementation.
4. Persistence or finish-until-done requests route to `ralph` only after scope is concrete.
5. Unknown or conflicting signals stay in this router and ask one concise clarification question.

## Automatic Routing Registry

When Hermes exposes installed skill descriptions to the model, use this registry as the routing map:

{_trigger_table(definitions)}

Routing is conservative: route only on explicit invocation, strong keyword evidence, or a clear workflow-shaped request. A bare common word such as `team`, `ask`, `wiki`, or `review` is not enough when it could mean normal conversation.

## Representative Harness Registry

Use these harnesses to shape the response before adding new skills. They are quality lanes, not proof that a separate runtime role exists.

{_harness_registry(harnesses)}

Harness priority:

1. Coding requests start with `coding-handling`.
2. Multi-step durable work adds `goal-execution`.
3. Unclear work uses `deep-interview` before `planning`.
4. Risky architecture uses `architect`, then `critic`.
5. User-visible behavior changes add `qa-specialist`.
6. Public commands, examples, or limitations add `docs-specialist`.

Recovery:

- If the right skill was not loaded, call `skills_list` or `skill_view`.
- If a slash command exists, use the explicit slash skill such as `/ralph`.
- If a skill name collides, ask the user whether to use the Hermes-native skill or the oh-my-hermes adapted skill.

## Hermes Compatibility

- Use Hermes tools and subagents when available.
- Replace unavailable goal tools with file-backed checklists or ledgers.
- Replace unavailable question renderers with one direct question through the current Hermes surface.
- Keep shell bridge behavior explicit and opt-in.

    body = f"""# {title}

This is a Hermes-native `{name}` workflow skill.

## Use When

{definition.use_when}

Strong routing signals: {triggers}

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
