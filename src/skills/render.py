def router_skill() -> SkillTemplate:
    definitions = builtin_definitions()
    harnesses = builtin_harnesses()
    body = f"""# Oh My Hermes Router

Use this skill when the user mentions oh-my-hermes or a workflow keyword such as `ralph`, `ultragoal`, `ultrawork`, `deep-interview`, `web-research`, `team`, `ultraqa`, `ralplan`, or `code-review`.

## Routing Contract

This is best-effort Hermes prompt guidance. It does not override Hermes core routing and it does not claim exact runtime parity with another agent framework.

Priority:

1. Explicit slash skill invocation wins.
2. Explicit workflow keywords route to the matching adapted skill when installed.
3. Broad planning requests route to `ralplan` or `plan` before implementation.
4. Persistence or finish-until-done requests route to `ralph` only after scope is concrete.
5. Unknown or conflicting signals stay in this router and ask one concise clarification question.

## Skill Role Classification

Keep compatible workflow names installed, but use this advisory wrapper guidance to decide what Hermes should own:

{_role_registry(definitions)}

General rule: Hermes should retain routing, web/source research, deep interview, planning, status, and evidence narration. This role metadata is advisory unless a wrapper/runtime artifact records observed enforcement. When the accepted next action mutates code, the wrapper should prepare a Codex handoff and track the lifecycle instead of implying Hermes coded secretly.

## Wrapper-Assisted Chat Routing

Discord, Slack, or hosted Hermes wrappers can run `omh chat route` before dispatching a plain chat message to Hermes:

```sh
omh chat route --source discord --record "risky refactor"
```

Use `route.routing_prompt_template` with `{{message}}` replaced by the received chat message as the prompt forwarded to Hermes. If the wrapper does not log stdout and wants a pre-expanded prompt, pass `--include-message` and forward `route.routing_prompt`. A `dispatch` action targets the selected workflow skill; `clarify` and `fallback` target this router so Hermes can ask one concise follow-up instead of guessing.

This is a deterministic wrapper-side decision layer. By default, stdout and runtime artifacts avoid duplicating the raw prompt body. It does not patch Hermes core or require platform network access from `omh`.

## Wrapper-Assisted Coding Delegation

When a chat message is implementation-shaped and the wrapper wants a concrete executor handoff, run `omh coding delegate` after or instead of generic chat routing:

```sh
omh coding delegate --source discord --record "risky refactor"
```

The command returns a `coding_delegation/v1` payload with a recommended workflow, harness, executor profile, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, and a `delegation_prompt_template` that the wrapper can forward with the user message substituted. It is deterministic and uses only local catalog metadata.

With `--record`, `omh` writes `coding_delegation.json` under `.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/`. The companion `run.json` is marked with `status: prepared`, `artifact_kind: prepared_coding_delegation`, `phase: prepared`, and `observation_status: prepared_not_observed`. These artifacts store only allowlisted metadata, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, recommendation evidence, source references, `message_sha256`, and `message_length`. Validation treats the run envelope and `coding_delegation.json` as a required pair. They mean a coding handoff was prepared; they do not mean Hermes executed the work or that a specialist lane was observed.

## Hermes-Facing Planning

For planning-shaped requests, wrappers or operators can run `omh hermes plan` to create a deterministic `hermes_plan/v1` planning scaffold:

```sh
omh hermes plan --source discord --record "risky refactor with review"
```

With `--record`, `omh` writes a Markdown draft under `.hermes/plans/`. Weak requests also write `.hermes/context/` so Hermes can ask one blocking clarification before a final plan. The plan includes goals, non-goals, options, risks, acceptance criteria, verification, execution handoff guidance, and a review gate. Review gate entries default to `not_observed`; do not call the plan approved unless wrapper or human evidence proves the review happened.

The stdout `wrapper_contract` is the adapter contract for follow-on wrapper work. Use it instead of parsing the Markdown file. For implementation-shaped draft plans, `wrapper_contract.coding_delegate.argv_template` gives the exact `omh coding delegate --record` argv shape to run with the original message after plan acceptance. For blocked or non-coding plans, `coding_delegate.available` is `false`; follow `wrapper_contract.next_action` and do not dispatch a coding handoff.

## Automatic Routing Registry

When Hermes exposes installed skill descriptions to the model, use this registry as the routing map:

{_trigger_table(definitions)}

Routing is conservative: route only on explicit invocation, strong keyword evidence, or a clear workflow-shaped request. A bare common word such as `team`, `ask`, `wiki`, or `review` is not enough when it could mean normal conversation.

## Representative Harness Registry

Use these harnesses to shape the response before adding new skills. They are quality lanes, not proof that a separate runtime role exists.

{_harness_registry(harnesses)}

Harness priority:

1. Coding requests start with `coding-handling`.
2. Multi-step durable work adds `goal-execution`.
3. Current-source or best-practice questions use the `research` harness and stay in Hermes-side evidence gathering before any coding handoff.
4. Unclear work uses `deep-interview` before `planning`.
5. Risky architecture uses `architect`, then `critic`.
6. User-visible behavior changes add `qa-specialist`.
7. Public commands, examples, or limitations add `docs-specialist`.

Recovery:

- If the right skill was not loaded, call `skills_list` or `skill_view`.
- If a slash command exists, use the explicit slash skill such as `/ralph`.
- If a skill name collides, ask the user whether to use the Hermes-native skill or the oh-my-hermes adapted skill.

## Hermes Compatibility

- Use Hermes tools and subagents when available.
- Replace unavailable goal tools with file-backed checklists or ledgers.
- Replace unavailable question renderers with one direct question through the current Hermes surface.
- Keep shell bridge behavior explicit and opt-in.

## Runtime Evidence

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record prepared handoffs and observed workflow evidence under `.omh/runtime/`.

Examples:

```sh
omh coding delegate --source discord --record "risky refactor"
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record only what is observed. A `coding_delegation.json` record and its `prepared_coding_delegation` run envelope prove a prepared handoff, not execution. If Hermes does not expose delegation metadata, use `not_observed` or `not_available` instead of implying a specialist lane ran.

This is a Hermes-native `{name}` workflow skill.

## Use When

{definition.use_when}

    Strong routing signals: {triggers}

## Catalog Metadata

{_skill_metadata_block(definition)}

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `{primary_harness}`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill {name} --harness {primary_harness} --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
