Use this skill when the user mentions oh-my-hermes or a workflow keyword such as `ralph`, `ultragoal`, `ultrawork`, `deep-interview`, `web-research`, `team`, `ultraqa`, `ralplan`, or `code-review`.

## Routing Contract

This is best-effort Hermes prompt guidance. It does not override Hermes core routing and it does not claim exact runtime parity with another agent framework.

Normal users should talk to Hermes Agent or invoke installed Hermes skills through Hermes' own skill surface. Do not ask chat users to run `omh` commands for ordinary workflow use. The `omh` command is bootstrap, maintenance, verification, and wrapper/backend infrastructure.

Hermes-native install paths should converge on the same skill-visible state:

- `hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent`, then `hermes skills install oh-my-hermes` installs this tap-compatible skill pack directly when Hermes supports taps.
- `omh setup` installs generated managed skills and registers their directory through `skills.external_dirs` when a local bootstrap or repair path is preferred.

Priority:

1. Explicit slash skill invocation wins.
2. Explicit workflow keywords route to the matching adapted skill when installed.
3. Broad planning requests route to `ralplan` or `plan` before implementation.
4. Persistence or finish-until-done requests route to `ralph` only after scope is concrete.
5. Unknown or conflicting signals stay in this router and ask one concise clarification question.

## Skill Role Classification

Keep compatible workflow names installed, but use this advisory wrapper guidance to decide what Hermes should own:

{_role_registry(definitions)}

General rule: Hermes should retain routing, web/source research, deep interview, planning, status, and evidence narration. This role metadata is advisory unless a wrapper/runtime artifact records observed enforcement. When the accepted next action mutates code, the wrapper should ask for or apply the selected executor profile, prepare the matching handoff, and track only evidence it actually observes instead of implying Hermes coded secretly.

{_target_topology_router_section()}

## Responsibility Roles

{role_summary_markdown()}

## Wrapper Backend Chat Routing

Discord, Slack, or hosted Hermes wrappers can run `omh chat route` before dispatching a plain chat message to Hermes. This is an adapter/backend call, not end-user UX:

```sh
omh chat route --source discord --record "risky refactor"
```

Use `route.routing_prompt_template` with `{{message}}` replaced by the received chat message as the prompt forwarded to Hermes. If the wrapper does not log stdout and wants a pre-expanded prompt, pass `--include-message` and forward `route.routing_prompt`. A `dispatch` action targets the selected workflow skill; `clarify` and `fallback` target this router so Hermes can ask one concise follow-up instead of guessing.

This is a deterministic wrapper-side decision layer. By default, stdout and runtime artifacts avoid duplicating the raw prompt body. It does not patch Hermes core or require platform network access from `omh`.

## Wrapper Backend Coding Delegation

When a chat message is implementation-shaped and the wrapper wants a concrete executor handoff, run `omh coding delegate` after or instead of generic chat routing. This prepares adapter data; Hermes still narrates the user-facing state:

```sh
omh coding delegate --source discord --executor codex --record "risky refactor"
```

The command returns a `coding_delegation/v1` payload with a recommended workflow, harness, executor profile, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, and a `delegation_prompt_template` that the wrapper can forward with the user message substituted. It is deterministic and uses only local catalog metadata. Without an explicit executor, wrappers can receive an executor-choice response; non-Codex executors receive prompt-only handoffs unless a tested lifecycle contract exists.

With `--record`, `omh` creates a `.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/` prepared runtime run only for a Codex-selected delegate payload that contains a real `executor_handoff`. Executor-choice, prompt-only, retained-Hermes, clarify, and fallback responses return `runtime.recorded=false` and must stay wrapper/session state rather than prepared run evidence. For Codex runs, `coding_delegation.json` is paired with `run.json` marked `status: prepared`, `artifact_kind: prepared_coding_delegation`, `phase: prepared`, and `observation_status: prepared_not_observed`. These artifacts store only allowlisted metadata, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, recommendation evidence, source references, `message_sha256`, and `message_length`. They mean a coding handoff was prepared; they do not mean Hermes executed the work or that a specialist lane was observed.

## Wrapper Backend Memory Context

Wrappers can run `omh memory inspect`, `omh memory pack`, and `omh memory apply` to review OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context before preparing a handoff. This emits `{MEMORY_REVIEW_SCHEMA}` and `{HANDOFF_CONTEXT_PACK_SCHEMA}` artifacts only; it does not read or mutate opaque Hermes internal memory. A context pack may be attached to an executor handoff only when unresolved conflicts are absent.

## Hermes-Facing Planning

For planning-shaped requests, wrappers or operators can run `omh hermes plan` to create a deterministic `hermes_plan/v1` planning scaffold. In normal chat, Hermes can express this plan directly through the installed skill guidance:

```sh
omh hermes plan --source discord --record "risky refactor with review"
```

With `--record`, `omh` writes a Markdown draft under `.hermes/plans/`. Weak requests also write `.hermes/context/` so Hermes can ask one blocking clarification before a final plan. The plan includes goals, non-goals, options, risks, acceptance criteria, verification, execution handoff guidance, and a review gate. Review gate entries default to `not_observed`; do not call the plan approved unless wrapper or human evidence proves the review happened.

The stdout `wrapper_contract` is the adapter contract for follow-on wrapper work. Use it instead of parsing the Markdown file. For implementation-shaped draft plans, `wrapper_contract.coding_delegate.argv_template` gives the exact `omh coding delegate --executor codex --record` argv shape for a run-backed Codex handoff after plan acceptance. For blocked or non-coding plans, `coding_delegate.available` is `false`; follow `wrapper_contract.next_action` and do not dispatch a coding handoff.

## Automatic Routing Registry

When Hermes exposes installed skill descriptions to the model, use this registry as the routing map:

{_trigger_table(definitions)}

Routing is conservative: route only on explicit invocation, strong keyword evidence, or a clear workflow-shaped request. A bare common word such as `team`, `ask`, `wiki`, or `review` is not enough when it could mean normal conversation.

## Representative Harness Registry

Use these harnesses to shape the response before adding new skills. They are quality lanes, not proof that a separate runtime role exists.

{_harness_registry(harnesses)}

Harness priority:

1. Coding requests start with `coding-handling`.
2. Multi-step durable work adds `goal-execution`.
3. Current-source or best-practice questions use the `research` harness and stay in Hermes-side evidence gathering before any coding handoff.
4. Unclear work uses `deep-interview` before `planning`.
5. Risky architecture uses `architect`, then `critic`.
6. User-visible behavior changes add `qa-specialist`.
7. Public commands, examples, or limitations add `docs-specialist`.

Recovery:

- If the right skill was not loaded, call `skills_list` or `skill_view`.
- If a slash command exists, use the explicit slash skill such as `/ralph`.
- If a skill name collides, ask the user whether to use the Hermes-native skill or the oh-my-hermes adapted skill.

## Hermes Compatibility

- Use Hermes tools and subagents when available.
- Replace unavailable goal tools with file-backed checklists or ledgers.
- Replace unavailable question renderers with one direct question through the current Hermes surface.
- Keep shell bridge behavior explicit and opt-in.

## Runtime Evidence

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record prepared handoffs and observed workflow evidence under `.omh/runtime/`.

Examples:

```sh
omh coding delegate --source discord --executor codex --record "risky refactor"
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record only what is observed. A Codex-selected `coding_delegation.json` record and its `prepared_coding_delegation` run envelope prove a prepared handoff, not execution. Executor-choice and prompt-only handoffs do not create runtime runs. If Hermes does not expose delegation metadata, use `not_observed` or `not_available` instead of implying a specialist lane ran.

This is a Hermes-native `{name}` workflow skill.

## Use When

{definition.use_when}

    Strong routing signals: {triggers}

## Catalog Metadata

{_skill_metadata_block(definition)}

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `{primary_harness}`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill {name} --harness {primary_harness} --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
{_target_topology_skill_contract_bullets()}
{_memory_context_skill_contract_bullets(definition)}
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
