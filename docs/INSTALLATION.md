# Installation

This guide is for users who want to install and apply the Hermes skill pack
without cloning this repository.

## Install

Run the installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

By default this installs the preview channel from the `main` branch archive.
For pinned stable installs, pass a release version:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_CHANNEL=stable OMH_VERSION=0.1.0 sh
```

For custom release archives or local package sources accepted by `pip`, pass
`OMH_PACKAGE_URL`.

The installer prepares the `omh` command, installs the managed Hermes skills,
registers the managed skill directory with Hermes, and checks the result.

After it finishes, restart Hermes Agent so it can reload the registered skill
directory.

## Verify

Check the installation:

```sh
omh doctor
omh list
omh runtime status
omh probe
```

`omh doctor` should report a healthy installation. `omh list` should show the
managed skills available to Hermes. `omh runtime status` should show the local
runtime artifact directory and the latest install/apply/doctor state when those
commands have run. `omh probe` reports observable Hermes capability surfaces
without mutating Hermes internals.

For concrete examples that show how the installed skills should affect coding,
planning, and specialist review flows, see
[Application Cases](APPLICATION_CASES.md).

## Discord Bot Flow

If Hermes Agent is running behind a Discord bot, install `oh-my-hermes-agent` on
the same machine, container, or runtime image that starts the bot.

The flow is:

1. The Discord bot receives a user message.
2. The bot can run `omh chat route --source discord --record "<message>"` to
   choose `dispatch`, `clarify`, or `fallback` before forwarding the request.
3. For implementation-shaped messages, the bot can run
   `omh coding delegate --source discord --record "<message>"` to prepare a
   deterministic executor handoff with metadata-only evidence.
4. The bot forwards `route.routing_prompt_template` or
   `delegation.delegation_prompt_template` with `{message}` replaced by
   the received message, or runs with `--include-message` and forwards
   `route.routing_prompt` / `delegation_prompt` when stdout is not logged.
5. Hermes starts with its normal config and reads `skills.external_dirs`.
6. `omh apply` makes sure `~/.omh/skills` is included in that discovery list.
7. Hermes sees the managed skills, including the `oh-my-hermes` router skill.
8. The router skill gives Hermes prompt-level routing guidance for workflow
   names, trigger phrases, fallback rules, and recovery behavior.
9. Hermes selects the relevant installed skill and continues the response inside
   the Discord bot flow.
10. The bot or operator can record local evidence with `omh runtime record` and
   `omh runtime delegate`.

`omh` does not replace the Discord bot, modify Discord commands, or patch Hermes
internals. It prepares the skill layer that Hermes can load when the bot invokes
Hermes, and it can make a local deterministic pre-dispatch routing decision for
the wrapper.

For a hosted bot, the practical deployment shape is usually:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
omh doctor
```

Then restart the bot process so Hermes reloads its config and skill directory.

Optional artifact-backed flow:

```sh
message='risky refactor'
delegate_json="$(omh coding delegate --source discord --record --include-message "$message")"
run_id="$(printf '%s' "$delegate_json" | python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["runtime"]["run"]["run_id"])')"
delegate_prompt="$(printf '%s' "$delegate_json" | python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["delegation_prompt"])')"

# Forward "$delegate_prompt" to Hermes.
# After Hermes responds, record what the bot could actually observe.
omh runtime delegate --run "$run_id" --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
omh runtime wrapper --run "$run_id" --prompt-dispatched --response-observed --completion-status completed --gap "specialist lane metadata not exposed"
omh runtime validate --run "$run_id"
omh runtime show "$run_id"
```

For hosted bots, run these commands inside the same container, virtual
environment, or user account that owns the bot runtime. If the wrapper can
observe a specialist lane result, record it with `--observed`; otherwise keep
the result as `not_observed`.

Use `omh runtime export --redacted` when you need a portable support artifact.
Exports redact prompt, response, token, secret, key, and password-shaped fields by
default while preserving proof fields such as run status, event names, observed
delegation flags, and wrapper completion status.

## Review Checklist

Before calling the bot integration ready, verify these points:

- The installer ran in the same runtime context as the Discord bot.
- `omh doctor` reports the managed skill directory as installed and registered.
- The bot process can read the same Hermes home/config that `omh apply` updated.
- The bot was restarted after installation or update.
- `omh chat route --source discord --record "<message>"` returns a route action
  and writes `routing.json` in the same runtime context as the bot.
- `omh coding delegate --source discord --record "<message>"` returns a
  `coding_delegation/v1` payload and writes `coding_delegation.json` with
  status `prepared_not_observed` for implementation-shaped requests.
- The companion `run.json` for that command is marked
  `artifact_kind: prepared_coding_delegation`, `phase: prepared`, and
  `observation_status: prepared_not_observed`; the run envelope is bookkeeping,
  not observed Hermes execution.
- A Discord message that strongly names a workflow reaches Hermes with installed
  skill descriptions available.
- `omh runtime record` can create a run and `omh runtime show <run-id>` can read
  it from the same runtime context.
- `omh probe` reports managed skills and external skill directory registration
  as available before any deeper integration claim is made.
- If skills do not appear, run `omh apply`, then `omh doctor`, then restart the
  bot again.

Current limitation: deeper execution still depends on Hermes loading and
exposing installed skills to the model. `omh chat route` and
`omh coding delegate` choose prompts and record metadata before dispatch, but the
bot adapter must forward the returned prompt template or opt into
`--include-message`, and Hermes must still load the managed skills.

## Update

Update the installed skill pack:

```sh
omh update --channel preview
omh apply
omh doctor
```

Use `omh update --channel stable --version <version>` to record a pinned stable
update intent, or `omh update --channel local --from-skills-dir ./skills` for a
local fixture. Local modifications block updates unless `--force` is supplied.
Use `omh apply` after an update to make sure Hermes still has the managed skill
directory registered, then restart Hermes Agent.

## Reapply

If Hermes does not show the installed skills, reapply the config registration:

```sh
omh apply
omh doctor
```

Then restart Hermes Agent.

## Install Options

Skip automatic Hermes config registration:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_AUTO_APPLY=0 sh
```

Skip the final health check:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh
```

Use the active environment instead of a user-level install:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_PIP_ARGS= sh
```

## Uninstall

Remove the Hermes config registration:

```sh
omh uninstall
```

Remove the registration and managed files:

```sh
omh uninstall --remove-files
```
