# Installation

This guide is for users who want to install and apply the Hermes skill pack
without cloning this repository.

## Install

Run the installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer prepares the `omh` command, installs the managed Hermes skills,
registers the managed skill directory with Hermes, and checks the result.

After it finishes, restart Hermes Agent so it can reload the registered skill
directory.

## Verify

Check the installation:

```sh
omh doctor
omh list
```

`omh doctor` should report a healthy installation. `omh list` should show the
managed skills available to Hermes.

## Discord Bot Flow

If Hermes Agent is running behind a Discord bot, install `oh-my-hermes-agent` on
the same machine, container, or runtime image that starts the bot.

The flow is:

1. The Discord bot receives a user message.
2. The bot forwards that request to Hermes Agent.
3. Hermes starts with its normal config and reads `skills.external_dirs`.
4. `omh apply` makes sure `~/.omh/skills` is included in that discovery list.
5. Hermes sees the managed skills, including the `oh-my-hermes` router skill.
6. The router skill gives Hermes prompt-level routing guidance for workflow
   names, trigger phrases, fallback rules, and recovery behavior.
7. Hermes selects the relevant installed skill and continues the response inside
   the Discord bot flow.

`omh` does not replace the Discord bot, modify Discord commands, or patch Hermes
internals. It prepares the skill layer that Hermes can load when the bot invokes
Hermes.

For a hosted bot, the practical deployment shape is usually:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
omh doctor
```

Then restart the bot process so Hermes reloads its config and skill directory.

## Review Checklist

Before calling the bot integration ready, verify these points:

- The installer ran in the same runtime context as the Discord bot.
- `omh doctor` reports the managed skill directory as installed and registered.
- The bot process can read the same Hermes home/config that `omh apply` updated.
- The bot was restarted after installation or update.
- A Discord message that strongly names a workflow reaches Hermes with installed
  skill descriptions available.
- If skills do not appear, run `omh apply`, then `omh doctor`, then restart the
  bot again.

Current limitation: routing is prompt-level guidance. It depends on Hermes
loading and exposing installed skills to the model. If the Discord bot runs
Hermes in a restricted mode that does not load external skill directories, the
bot adapter or Hermes startup config must be updated to allow that discovery
path.

## Update

Update the installed skill pack:

```sh
omh update
omh apply
omh doctor
```

Use `omh apply` after an update to make sure Hermes still has the managed skill
directory registered.

## Reapply

If Hermes does not show the installed skills, reapply the config registration:

```sh
omh apply
omh doctor
```

Then restart Hermes Agent.

## Install Options

Skip automatic Hermes config registration:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_AUTO_APPLY=0 sh
```

Skip the final health check:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh
```

Use the active environment instead of a user-level install:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_PIP_ARGS= sh
```

## Uninstall

Remove the Hermes config registration:

```sh
omh uninstall
```

Remove the registration and managed files:

```sh
omh uninstall --remove-files
```
