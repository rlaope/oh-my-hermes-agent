# Direction

## Product Thesis

OMHM is a Hermes-native wrapper orchestration layer.

It should make Hermes feel mature in chat surfaces without pretending Hermes is
the main coding executor. The product is not a clone of a Codex-side workflow
runtime. It borrows the discipline of staged workflows, local state, and
evidence gates, then translates that discipline into Hermes-native chat,
planning, status, and handoff contracts.

## Project Type

OMHM is:

- a local installer for managed Hermes skills
- a deterministic skill catalog and router contract
- a wrapper-native chat contract for Discord, Slack, and hosted adapters
- a Hermes-facing planning artifact generator
- a metadata-only evidence ledger for prepared and observed handoffs
- a delegation-first bridge from Hermes requests to Codex-like coding executors

OMHM is not:

- a Hermes core patch
- a Discord or Slack bot implementation
- an LLM router or network service
- a hidden coding runtime
- a claim that Hermes executed work that only a handoff prepared

## Ownership Boundary

Hermes owns:

- chat intake
- clarification
- source-backed research
- planning
- skill and workflow narration
- user-facing status continuity

OMH owns:

- deterministic local contracts
- generated Hermes skill content
- metadata-only runtime artifacts
- wrapper session state
- prepared coding handoff payloads
- derived status that separates prepared intent from observed evidence

Codex-like executors own:

- main implementation work
- code changes
- code review fixes
- verification execution
- merge-readiness work

## Direction Rules

1. Keep users command-agnostic in chat.
   Discord, Slack, and hosted wrappers should accept natural language and render
   skill, plan, status, and handoff UX without requiring users to know OMH
   commands.

2. Preserve prepared versus observed boundaries.
   `prepared_not_observed` means a handoff exists. It does not mean execution,
   review, CI, merge readiness, or merge happened.

3. Keep Hermes retained work high quality.
   Deep interview, source-backed research, planning, status narration, and
   evidence synthesis should improve inside Hermes-facing surfaces.

4. Delegate main coding deliberately.
   Coding-heavy work should become a prepared Codex-like executor handoff with
   scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, and review
   expectations.

5. Prefer local deterministic artifacts over hidden magic.
   Runtime records, wrapper sessions, and plans should be inspectable,
   schema-versioned, redacted by default, and local-only unless a wrapper
   outside this repository performs transport work.

6. Do not widen into platform transports prematurely.
   Transport adapters, auth, retries, message edits, and posting belong outside
   this repository until their dependency and packaging story is explicitly
   approved.

7. Treat compatibility skill names as UX affordances.
   Workflow names may remain installed for familiarity, but their generated
   role and handoff policies must describe the Hermes-native boundary rather
   than implying copied runtime behavior.

## Delivery Grain

One user goal should normally produce one PR.

Inside that PR, multiple focused commits are fine: plan/documentation, tests,
implementation, review fixes, and CI fixes can all live in the same goal PR.
Do not split review feedback, follow-up test fixes, or small documentation
adjustments into new PRs unless they are independently releasable goals or the
user explicitly asks for a separate PR.

Split into separate PRs only when:

- the next change has a different user-facing goal
- the work has independent release or rollback value
- the current PR would become too risky to review coherently
- a dependency or external decision blocks part of the work
- the user explicitly requests stacked or separate PRs

## Strategic Milestones

1. Direction lock.
   Keep this document, architecture docs, README, generated skills, examples,
   and tests aligned around delegation-first wrapper orchestration.

2. Wrapper-native UX depth.
   Add golden JSON and pseudocode examples for Discord and Slack actions,
   threads, buttons, and status updates without adding transport dependencies.

3. Evidence completeness.
   Add first-class review, CI, merge-readiness, and merge observation records at
   the run level while keeping wrapper sessions as chat continuity only.

4. Retained cognition quality.
   Improve Hermes-side research, deep interview, and planning skills so
   non-coding requests feel first-class rather than like coding handoff
   leftovers.

5. Adapter boundary readiness.
   Only after the local contract is stable, consider example shims or adapter
   packages that consume `chat_interaction/v1` without moving platform secrets
   or network behavior into core OMH.

## Review Checklist

Before accepting direction-changing work, verify:

- Does it keep Hermes as orchestrator and narrator, not hidden coder?
- Does it keep coding execution in a Codex-like handoff when code changes are
  required?
- Does it preserve `prepared_not_observed` until wrapper evidence exists?
- Does it avoid Hermes core patching, LLM/API calls, and transport networking?
- Does it keep chat users free from command knowledge?
- Does it fit one coherent goal PR unless there is a clear reason to split?
