# Harness Quality Contract

`harness_quality/v1` is the small machine-readable contract that tells a chat
wrapper what quality gate a workflow lane is using.

It exists so Discord, Slack, or hosted Hermes wrappers can render better UX
without teaching end users command names or parsing generated skill prose.

## What Users Get

For a chat user, this changes the experience from vague status copy to explicit
state:

- "I need one answer before planning" for clarification lanes.
- "A draft plan is ready to accept or revise" for planning lanes.
- "Feedback is clustered, but no roadmap or coding handoff exists yet" for
  customer triage lanes.
- "A meeting agenda is prepared, but the meeting outcome is not observed yet"
  for meeting lanes.
- "An ops review names risks and blockers, but it is not CI or release
  evidence" for operating review lanes.
- "A coding handoff is prepared, but execution is not observed yet" for coding
  lanes.
- "Review or CI is still missing" before merge-ready status is shown.

The wrapper can choose buttons from `wrapper_actions`, show progress from
`evidence_ladder`, and avoid false claims with `overclaim_guards`.
Local operators can inspect the same contract with `omh harness list`,
`omh harness inspect <name>`, and `omh harness validate`.

## Contract Shape

Every generated workflow catalog entry and relevant runtime payload can expose a
contract shaped like this:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "harness_quality/v1",
  "harness": "coding-handling",
  "quality_tier": "handoff-gated",
  "quality_bar": [
    "Clarify scope before edits when target behavior, files, or verification are missing.",
    "Attach acceptance criteria, verification expectations, and review expectations to the prepared handoff.",
    "Report coding progress from lifecycle evidence, not from the existence of a prepared prompt."
  ],
  "evidence_ladder": [
    "coding_delegation_prepared",
    "executor_dispatch_observed",
    "executor_result_observed",
    "verification_recorded",
    "review_ci_merge_recorded_when_required"
  ],
  "wrapper_actions": ["accept_plan", "show_prompt_handoff", "copy_prompt_handoff", "choose_executor", "send_to_executor", "send_to_codex", "show_status", "record_result"],
  "overclaim_guards": [
    "A prepared coding_delegation.json is not implementation evidence.",
    "Executor completion is not review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence."
  ]
}
```

## Where It Appears

- `omh docs workflows --json` exposes the full local workflow and harness
  catalog, including `workflow_catalog/v1.harnesses[].harness_quality`.
- `omh coding delegate` includes `harness_quality` beside the prepared
  delegation. Dispatch actions are removed unless the payload also includes a
  prepared executor handoff.
- `omh coding delegate --executor codex` includes the dispatch-capable contract
  in both the public payload and `executor_handoff` when the request is specific
  enough to delegate. The primary action is `send_to_executor`; `send_to_codex`
  remains a compatibility alias only for Codex-selected flows.
- `omh coding delegate --executor claude-code`, `--executor omx-runtime`, or
  `--executor generic` returns a prompt-only handoff. It can expose
  `show_prompt_handoff`, `copy_prompt_handoff`, and `choose_executor`, but it
  must not create a lifecycle run or observed execution evidence.
- `omh hermes plan` includes `wrapper_contract.harness_quality` so wrappers can
  render accept/revise/cancel and handoff readiness from the plan contract.
- Runtime records preserve the contract in `coding_delegation.json` when present.
- `omh runtime delegation-status --run <run-id>` includes
  `harness_progress/v1`, which marks ladder steps complete only when the
  corresponding runtime or wrapper evidence is observed.

## Wrapper Rules

- Use `wrapper_actions` as platform-neutral action ids; map them to buttons,
  menu items, or thread actions in the adapter.
- Use `evidence_ladder` to show progress, but mark a step complete only when a
  runtime record or wrapper observation proves it.
- Use `quality_bar` as the lane's success checklist.
- Use `overclaim_guards` before changing status text. If a guard conflicts with
  a later artifact, show the blocker instead of the optimistic state.
- Treat `harness_progress/v1.next_step` as a wrapper hint, not as proof that the
  next action has already happened.

## Golden Examples

See `examples/wrapper-golden/harness-quality.json` for deterministic examples
covering coding handoff, planning, research, and clarification lanes.

The business workflow pack adds non-coding harnesses such as
`business-research`, `strategy-synthesis`, `meeting-facilitation`,
`customer-insight-triage`, and `ops-review`. These give wrappers the same
evidence discipline for company work: research briefs are not fetched data,
strategy briefs are not accepted decisions, meeting briefs are not meeting
minutes, feedback triage is not a roadmap, and ops review is not release or CI
evidence.
