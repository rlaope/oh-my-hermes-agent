# Application Cases

This guide documents the first three proof cases for `oh-my-hermes-agent`.
Each case is designed to show visible skill impact without claiming hidden
Hermes runtime behavior.

## Case 1: Coding Request Handling

### Setup

Install the Hermes skill pack through Hermes' native skill surface:

```sh
hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent
hermes skills install oh-my-hermes
```

If the deployment needs the managed bootstrap path, install and verify the same
Hermes-visible state through OMH:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
omh setup
omh doctor
```

Restart Hermes Agent after installation so it can reload its configured skill
directories.

### User Prompt Shape

Ask Hermes for a concrete coding task, such as a focused bug fix, review, or
small feature request.

Strong signals include:

- a file path
- an error message
- a function or module name
- explicit verification requirements

### Expected Hermes-Facing Behavior

Hermes should use the installed `oh-my-hermes` router guidance and the
`coding-handling` harness to keep the response scoped around:

- target behavior
- relevant repo context
- changed files
- verification evidence
- remaining risks

If the prompt is too broad, the harness directs Hermes to ask one concise
clarification question before editing.

### Verification

After installation, inspect the managed skill list:

```sh
omh list
```

For repository development, verify the generated router content through tests:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Artifact-backed verification can be recorded without capturing prompt bodies:

```sh
run_json="$(omh runtime record --skill oh-my-hermes --harness coding-handling --status started)"
run_id="$(printf '%s' "$run_json" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["run"]["run_id"])')"
omh runtime delegate --run "$run_id" --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
omh runtime show "$run_id"
```

This proves the workflow was tracked locally while preserving the distinction
between requested review/delegation and delegation that Hermes actually exposed.

### Current Limit

This case verifies installed prompt guidance and generated skill content.
It does not prove that Hermes has a hidden runtime hook or automatic internal
router beyond Hermes' normal skill loading behavior.

## Case 2: Goal, Planning, and Deep Interview Flow

### Setup

Confirm the skill pack is installed through Hermes or registered through the
OMH bootstrap path:

```sh
hermes skills install deep-interview
hermes skills install ralplan
omh setup
omh doctor
```

### User Prompt Shape

Use this flow when the user describes a broad product or coding objective that
needs clarification before execution.

Strong signals include:

- unclear scope
- missing non-goals
- a request to plan before coding
- a long-running objective that needs checkpoints

### Expected Hermes-Facing Behavior

Hermes should use:

- `deep-interview` when intent, boundaries, or decision authority are unclear
- `planning` when requirements are clear enough for sequencing and test shape
- `goal-execution` when the work needs durable checkpoints or finish-until-done
  pressure

The expected output is a clarified brief or plan before implementation starts.
When Hermes lacks a dedicated goal tool, the compatibility contract tells it to
use a file-backed checklist or explicit local ledger.

### Verification

Inspect generated skills after install:

```sh
omh list
```

Repository maintainers can verify generated content through tests:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Artifact-backed verification:

```sh
run_json="$(omh runtime record --skill ultragoal --harness goal-execution --status started)"
run_id="$(printf '%s' "$run_json" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["run"]["run_id"])')"
omh runtime delegate --run "$run_id" --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
omh runtime show "$run_id"
```

Use `not_observed` when the active Hermes surface does not expose a separate
goal runner or planner identity.

### Current Limit

This case is prompt-level workflow guidance unless a future Hermes extension
surface provides deeper state or goal integration.

## Case 3: Specialist Harness Flow

### Setup

Install the skill pack through Hermes, or make sure Hermes can read the same
config that `omh apply` updated when using the bootstrap path:

```sh
hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent
hermes skills install oh-my-hermes
omh setup
omh doctor
```

For Discord bot deployments, install in the same runtime context that starts
the bot, then restart the bot process.

### User Prompt Shape

Use this flow for work that needs stronger review or a release-quality answer.

Strong signals include:

- architecture or integration risk
- public documentation changes
- user-visible workflow changes
- release or quality-gate language
- requests for critique, QA, or docs review

### Expected Hermes-Facing Behavior

Hermes should shape the work through the representative specialist harnesses:

- `research` for current, official, or source-backed evidence gathering
- `architect` for boundaries, integration choices, and maintainability
- `critic` for consistency, missing checks, and residual risk
- `qa-specialist` for adversarial scenarios and pass/fail evidence
- `docs-specialist` for accurate commands, examples, and limitations

These are quality lanes. They are not proof that Hermes spawned a separate
runtime role unless the active Hermes environment exposes that capability.

### Verification

The router skill should include each specialist harness name, inputs, outputs,
verification expectations, quality tier, evidence ladder, wrapper actions,
overclaim guards, and fallback behavior.

Repository maintainers can verify this with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Artifact-backed verification:

```sh
run_json="$(omh runtime record --skill code-review --harness critic --status completed)"
run_id="$(printf '%s' "$run_json" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["run"]["run_id"])')"
omh runtime delegate --run "$run_id" --requested --not-observed --result not_observed --evidence-ref run.json
omh runtime show "$run_id"
```

If a bot wrapper can observe separate specialist outputs, it can record
`--observed --result completed --participants architect,critic`. Otherwise the
artifact should remain explicit that delegation was not observed.

### Current Limit

If Hermes delegation is unavailable, the harness still improves response
quality by making Hermes run the specialist checks sequentially in the current
conversation.

## Case 4: Situation Playbook Pipeline

### Setup

No additional end-user setup is required beyond Hermes seeing the installed
OMH skills. Wrapper operators can use a working `omh` command to inspect the
same playbook contracts locally.

### User Prompt Shape

Use this flow when a wrapper or maintainer wants to decide the whole pipeline
for a natural request before choosing low-level commands.

Strong signals include:

- a safe feature or refactor request
- a request for current source-backed research
- an ambiguous goal that needs interview before planning
- a recurring process or pipeline buildout
- release-readiness, QA, CI, or merge-readiness review

### Expected Hermes-Facing Behavior

The playbook layer picks a situation-level path above individual skills:

- `safe-feature-change` for plan-first coding handoff
- `source-backed-research` for Hermes-owned research
- `deep-interview-to-plan` for ambiguity reduction
- `local-pipeline-buildout` for repeatable wrapper process design
- `release-readiness-review` for review, QA, CI, and merge-readiness status

The playbook response names which stages stay with Hermes, which stages become
executor handoffs, and which claims must stay pending until evidence is
observed.

### Verification

Inspect the playbook catalog:

```sh
omh playbook list
omh playbook inspect safe-feature-change
omh playbook recommend "I want to safely add a feature to this repo"
```

Repository maintainers can verify playbook behavior through tests:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=tests python3 -m unittest tests/test_cli.py -v
```

### Current Limit

Playbooks are deterministic local contracts. They do not post messages,
authenticate transport bots, launch coding executors, or prove that a later
stage happened. Runtime status must still come from observed evidence records.

## Release Review Checklist

Before using these cases as public release evidence, verify:

- The one-command installer still works.
- `hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent` and
  `hermes skills install oh-my-hermes` are documented as the primary install
  path when Hermes taps are available.
- `omh setup` reports the managed skill directory, equivalent Hermes install
  intent, and Hermes config registration clearly.
- `omh doctor` reports the managed skill directory as healthy after setup.
- The generated router includes the representative harness registry.
- `omh docs workflows --json` exposes `harness_quality/v1` style quality data
  for wrapper rendering and status decisions.
- `omh playbook recommend` returns situation-level pipelines for safe coding,
  source-backed research, deep interview to plan, local pipeline buildout, and
  release-readiness review.
- The four cases above match actual generated skill and playbook behavior.
- Runtime-backed cases above can create `.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/`
  artifacts.
- `delegation.json` separates requested delegation from observed delegation.
- `omh probe` output is captured before any native hook, plugin, app, MCP, or
  internal routing claim is made.
- Public docs avoid comparisons to other projects.
- Any real Hermes runtime behavior that could not be automated is listed as a
  manual check.
