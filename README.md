**oh-my-hermes-agent** installs a Hermes-native workflow layer for routing,
planning, chat-wrapper UX, evidence tracking, and coding handoff preparation.

Hermes stays the chat-facing agent. OMHM adds deterministic local contracts
around it so Discord, Slack, hosted wrappers, and local operators can turn a
plain user message into a clear next step: answer, clarify, research, plan,
delegate coding, or report status.

## Why OMHM

- **Natural-language first** - users in chat do not need to know `omh` commands.
- **Hermes-native boundary** - no Hermes core patching, hidden transport bot, or
  network service inside this package.
- **Delegation-first coding** - coding-heavy requests become prepared handoffs
  for external coding executors, with review, verification, and Codex `$skill`
  invocation expectations.
- **Evidence-aware status** - prepared, dispatched, executed, reviewed,
  verified, CI, and merge-ready states stay separate.
- **Local and inspectable** - skills, manifests, plans, sessions, and runtime
  records live in user-owned local directories.

## What You Get

| Surface | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| Hermes skill tap | Tap-compatible skills under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Hermes-native install. |
| Bootstrap setup | `omh setup` installs the same generated skills under `~/.omh/skills` and registers `skills.external_dirs`. |
| Skill catalog | Deterministic routing metadata from `src/skills/catalog.py`. |
| Playbooks | Situation-level pipelines for research, planning, wrapper UX, and coding handoff flows. |
| Harness quality | Machine-readable quality bars, evidence ladders, wrapper actions, and overclaim guards. |
| Wrapper backend contract | `chat_interaction/v1` responses for Discord, Slack, and hosted adapters. |
| Planning artifacts | Hermes-facing Markdown plans under `~/.hermes/plans`. |
| Coding handoffs | Prepared executor payloads with acceptance, review, and verification expectations. |
| Runtime evidence | Metadata-only run/session records under `~/.omh/runtime`. |

## Quick Start

**Step 1: Install the Hermes skills**

```sh
hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent
hermes skills install oh-my-hermes
```

Install additional workflow skills when you want them exposed directly in
Hermes:

```sh
hermes skills install deep-interview
hermes skills install ralplan
hermes skills install web-research
hermes skills install code-review
```

**Step 2: Talk to Hermes**

Send a normal message in Hermes Agent, Discord, Slack, or a hosted Hermes
wrapper:

```text
I want to safely add a feature to this repo
```

Hermes should use the installed OMH guidance to decide whether to answer,
clarify, research, plan, prepare a coding handoff, or report status. Users
should not need to know `omh recommend`, `omh chat interact`, or other backend
commands.

## Two Install Paths

### Path A: Hermes-native skill install

Use this when Hermes skill taps are available in the target environment:

```sh
hermes skills tap add rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent
hermes skills install oh-my-hermes
```

This installs from the repo's tap-compatible `skills/` directory and keeps the
main UX inside Hermes.

### Path B: OMH bootstrap setup

Use this when you want a Python installer, repair command, generated managed
skills, local doctor checks, or wrapper/backend commands:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
omh setup
omh doctor
```

`omh setup` installs generated skills under `~/.omh/skills` and registers that
directory through Hermes' `skills.external_dirs`. The intended final state is
the same from the user's point of view: Hermes sees OMH skills, and the user
talks to Hermes.

**Optional operator smoke test**

```sh
omh chat interact --source discord "I want to safely add a feature to this repo"
```

That returns a `chat_interaction/v1` JSON envelope a Discord, Slack, or hosted
adapter can render without exposing shell commands to the end user.

**Optional local demo**

```sh
omh demo orchestration
```

The demo is deterministic and transport-free. It shows the full
recommend -> chat response -> Hermes plan -> Codex handoff -> status card path
without calling an LLM, bot SDK, network API, or Hermes core patch.

**Optional playbook inspection**

```sh
omh playbook recommend "I want to safely add a feature to this repo"
```

Playbooks are backend/operator contracts that describe the wrapper-visible
pipeline for situations such as source-backed research, deep interview to plan,
safe feature change, release-readiness review, and local pipeline buildout.

### Stable Install

The default installer target is the preview channel from `main`. For a pinned
stable install, use a published release tag:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_CHANNEL=stable OMH_VERSION=<version> sh
```

Replace `<version>` with a released version after the matching `v<version>` tag
exists.

### Updating

```sh
omh update
omh setup
omh doctor
```

## Mental Model

OMHM is a local contract layer around Hermes, not a replacement runtime.

```text
User chat
  -> Hermes Agent with installed OMH skills
  -> optional Discord, Slack, or hosted wrapper
  -> optional OMH backend contract for buttons, plans, handoffs, and status
  -> external executor only when coding work is accepted
  -> observed evidence recorded back into local runtime artifacts
```

`omh apply` updates only Hermes' `skills.external_dirs` registration. It does
not rewrite workspace instructions or modify Hermes internals.

## Wrapper Backend Flow

Wrappers can treat `omh chat interact` as their local backend API. End users
should see Hermes chat responses, buttons, threads, and status cards, not shell
commands.

1. Receive a natural-language user message.
2. Call `omh chat interact` with a platform source and message or event JSON.
3. Render `chat_response.headline`, `body`, `state`, `actions`, and
   `status_card` when present.
4. Wait for clarification, plan acceptance, revision, cancellation, or handoff
   action.
5. If coding is accepted, dispatch the prepared handoff to an external coding
   executor outside OMHM.
6. Record only observed progress back into the lifecycle or runtime evidence
   commands.

The wrapper user sees a normal chat UX. The adapter owns buttons, threads,
message edits, dispatch, and platform credentials.

Source-checkout examples show how a transport shim can render fixture events
without Discord or Slack SDKs:

```sh
uv run python examples/discord-adapter-shim.py
uv run python examples/slack-adapter-shim.py
```

Those shims read JSON under `examples/wrapper-events/` and emit a compact
`wrapper_adapter_shim/v1` render payload with response copy, action ids, and
status card data when present.

## What Gets Recorded

`omh` records runtime metadata only by default:

- setup/install/apply/doctor summaries in `~/.omh/runtime/state.json`
- workflow run envelopes in `~/.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/run.json`
- append-only run events in `events.jsonl`
- wrapper chat sessions in `~/.omh/runtime/wrapper_sessions/<session-id>/`
- delegation observation in `delegation.json`
- prepared coding handoffs in `coding_delegation.json`
- wrapper observation in `wrapper.json`
- review, CI, and merge evidence in `review.json`, `ci.json`, and
  `merge.json`

Prepared handoff is never treated as implementation, review, CI, or merge
evidence by itself. If the wrapper cannot prove that a step happened, status
should stay `prepared_not_observed`, `not_observed`, or `not_available`.
Status readers evaluate the full run ledger conservatively: a later merge-ready
artifact cannot override missing verification, review, or CI evidence.
Wrapper status responses include a `status_card/v1` progress object so adapters
can render handoff, execution, verification, review, CI, merge-ready, and merged
steps without parsing prose.
Workflow and handoff payloads can also include `harness_quality/v1`, which lets
adapters render the lane quality bar, evidence ladder, safe action ids, and
overclaim guards without guessing from generated skill text.
Runtime delegation status also includes `harness_progress/v1`, calculated from
that evidence ladder and observed runtime records.

Inspect and validate the live harness catalog with:

```sh
omh harness list
omh harness inspect coding-handling
omh harness validate
```

## Routing Model

The `oh-my-hermes` skill is the top-level router.

It is prompt-level guidance, not a hidden runtime hook. Explicit skill
invocation wins, strong workflow signals route to catalog-backed skills, broad
planning requests stay in planning first, and ambiguous messages ask one concise
clarification question.

The generated catalog classifies each workflow by role:

| Role | Examples | Default behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retained cognition | `web-research`, `deep-interview`, `plan`, `ralplan` | Hermes handles clarification, research, planning, and status narration. |
| Handoff guidance | `ultragoal`, `ultrawork`, cleanup workflows | Hermes prepares and tracks coding handoffs instead of implying hidden implementation. |
| Verification | `code-review`, `ultraqa` | Hermes can frame review and QA expectations; code fixes remain executor work. |

Actual Discord and Slack transports stay outside this repository. `omh` does
not open network connections, authenticate bots, post messages, invoke Codex, or
patch Hermes internals.

Hermes plans include a deterministic `quality_gate` and `deep_interview`
contract. Blocked plans ask one concise question; draft plans remain unapproved
until the wrapper or user accepts them.

## Backend / Operator Surface

The primary product surface is installed Hermes skills. The `omh` command is
support infrastructure for bootstrap, repair, verification, wrapper contracts,
smoke tests, runtime evidence, and operator debugging.

```

## Roadmap

This repository is a quality-gated preview. Current work focuses on making
Hermes-side chat orchestration feel complete while keeping execution claims
evidence-backed and local.

- Versioned release artifacts for stable installer targets
- A richer generated routing registry
- More artifact-backed bot and workflow examples
- More Hermes-specific diagnostics in `omh doctor`
- Workflow fixtures that verify generated skill behavior remains conservative
