## What It Is

`oh-my-hermes-agent` is a local installer and skill pack for Hermes Agent.

It writes managed skills to `~/.omh/skills`, registers that directory in Hermes'
`skills.external_dirs`, and gives Hermes a consistent workflow layer without
patching Hermes core files.

The initial pack includes workflow skills for:

- routing and skill selection
- requirement clarification
- reviewed planning
- durable goal ledgers
- persistent execution loops
- coordinated work lanes
- adversarial QA
- code review
- behavior-preserving cleanup
- research, project notes, cancellation, skill management, and diagnostics

## Status

This repository is a quality-gated preview: small enough to inspect, but shaped
as a real public project instead of a throwaway script.

The current release provides a local installer, generated Hermes skill catalog,
application cases, runtime diagnostics, local runtime artifacts, CI, and
contributor guidance. The next direction is deeper Hermes-side integration:
richer routing metadata, stronger wrapper examples, release packaging, and
Hermes-specific workflow tests.

## Quick Start

Install and apply the managed Hermes skill pack without cloning the repository:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then open Hermes Agent and use the installed skills through Hermes' normal skill
surfaces.

For the full install, Discord bot deployment, update, reapply, and uninstall
flow, see [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

For reproducible skill-impact examples, see
[Application Cases](docs/APPLICATION_CASES.md).

Check or manage the installation with `omh`:

```sh
omh doctor
omh list
omh runtime status
omh state status
omh update
```

Installer options:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_AUTO_APPLY=0 sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_PIP_ARGS= sh
```

Useful commands:

```sh
omh install --dry-run
omh install --from-skills-dir ./skills
omh update --from-skills-dir ./skills
omh apply --dry-run
omh runtime record --skill oh-my-hermes --harness coding-handling --status started
omh runtime runs
omh docs workflows
omh list
omh snippet --dry-run
omh uninstall
```

## Mental Model

Hermes remains the agent runtime.

`omh` adds three things around it:

1. A managed skill directory at `~/.omh/skills`
2. A manifest at `~/.omh/manifest.json`
3. Local runtime artifacts under `~/.omh/runtime`
4. A config registration in Hermes' `skills.external_dirs`

That means installation is reversible and inspectable. `omh apply` updates only
the Hermes skill discovery setting. It does not rewrite workspace instructions
or modify Hermes internals.

## What Gets Recorded

`omh` records local metadata only by default:

- install/apply/doctor summaries in `~/.omh/runtime/state.json`
- workflow run envelopes in `~/.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/run.json`
- append-only run events in `events.jsonl`
- delegation observation in `delegation.json`

Delegation artifacts separate `requested` from `observed`. If Hermes or a bot
wrapper cannot prove that a specialist lane actually ran, the result should stay
`not_observed` or `not_available`.

## Routing Model

The `oh-my-hermes` skill is the top-level router.

It is prompt-level guidance, not a hidden runtime hook. When Hermes exposes
installed skill descriptions to the model, the router gives Hermes a clear
registry of workflow names, strong trigger phrases, conservative fallback rules,
and recovery steps.

Routing priority:

1. Explicit slash skill invocation wins.
2. Strong workflow keywords route to the matching installed skill.
3. Broad planning requests route to `ralplan` or `plan` before implementation.
4. Finish-until-done requests route to `ralph` only after scope is concrete.
5. Unknown or conflicting signals stay in `oh-my-hermes` and ask one concise
   clarification question.

A bare common word such as `team`, `ask`, `wiki`, or `review` is not enough when
it could mean normal conversation.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `omh install` | Install the built-in Hermes skill pack. |
| `omh update` | Reinstall from the built-in pack or a provided skill directory. |
| `omh convert --from-skills-dir <dir>` | Import local `SKILL.md` files into the managed pack. |
| `omh apply` | Register `~/.omh/skills` in Hermes `skills.external_dirs`. |
| `omh list` | Print the installed manifest. |
| `omh doctor` | Verify managed files and Hermes config registration. |
| `omh runtime status` | Inspect local runtime artifact state. |
| `omh runtime record` | Create a metadata-only workflow run artifact. |
| `omh runtime delegate` | Record observed or unavailable delegation for a run. |
| `omh state status` | Inspect file-backed workflow lifecycle state under `~/.omh/state`. |
| `omh docs workflows` | Print or verify the generated workflow reference from catalog data. |
| `omh snippet` | Print optional workspace guidance without applying it. |
| `omh uninstall` | Remove Hermes config registration, optionally removing files. |

## Package Layout

```text
src/
  cli.py                 command-line entrypoint
  config_adapter.py      Hermes config registration adapter
  converter.py           local skill import support
  doctor.py              installation health checks
  installer.py           managed skill pack install/update/uninstall
  manifest.py            installed file manifest and conflict checks
  paths.py               home/config path resolution
  snippet.py             optional workspace guidance
  skill_pack.py          compatibility facade for generated skills
  core/
    errors.py            shared user-facing error type
  skills/
    catalog.py           workflow definitions and routing triggers
    render.py            generated Hermes skill content
```

The important design choice is that routing data lives in
`src/skills/catalog.py` and rendered skill text lives in
`src/skills/render.py`. This keeps the workflow registry testable as data
instead of burying routing behavior in one long string.

## Safety

- Existing managed files are protected by `~/.omh/manifest.json`.
- Local modifications are not overwritten unless `--force` is supplied.
- `omh apply --dry-run` shows config changes without writing.
- `omh uninstall` removes config registration first; file deletion requires
  `--remove-files`.
- Tests use temporary homes and do not mutate the real `~/.hermes`.

## Development

Install the current checkout in editable mode:

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run the test suite:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m compileall src
```

Smoke-test the installer without touching real home directories:

```sh
python -m omh.cli --omh-home /tmp/omh-smoke --hermes-home /tmp/hermes-smoke install --dry-run
```

## Roadmap

- Versioned release artifacts for stable installer targets
- A richer generated routing registry
- More artifact-backed bot and workflow examples
- More Hermes-specific diagnostics in `omh doctor`
- Command-level tests for uninstall, snippet output, and imported skill edge cases
- Workflow fixtures that verify generated skill behavior remains conservative
