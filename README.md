## What It Is

`oh-my-hermes-agent` is a local installer and skill pack for Hermes Agent.

It writes managed skills to `~/.omh/skills`, registers that directory in Hermes'
`skills.external_dirs`, and gives Hermes a consistent workflow layer without
patching Hermes core files.

The initial pack includes workflow skills for:

- routing and skill selection
- requirement clarification
- reviewed planning
- durable goal ledgers
- persistent execution loops
- coordinated work lanes
- adversarial QA
- code review
- behavior-preserving cleanup
- research, project notes, cancellation, skill management, and diagnostics

## Status

This repository is a quality-gated preview: small enough to inspect, but shaped
as a real public project instead of a throwaway script.

The current release provides a local installer, generated Hermes skill catalog,
application cases, runtime diagnostics, local runtime artifacts, wrapper-native
chat contracts, CI, and contributor guidance. The next direction is deeper
adapter integration: example Discord/Slack shims, richer routing metadata,
release packaging, and Hermes-specific workflow tests.

For the product boundary and delivery philosophy, see
[Direction](docs/DIRECTION.md).

## Quick Start

Install and apply the managed Hermes skill pack without cloning the repository:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

The default installer target is the preview channel from `main`. For a pinned
stable install, use a tagged release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_CHANNEL=stable OMH_VERSION=0.1.0 sh
```

Then open Hermes Agent and use the installed skills through Hermes' normal skill
surfaces.

For the full install, Discord bot deployment, update, reapply, and uninstall
flow, see [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

For reproducible skill-impact examples, see
[Application Cases](docs/APPLICATION_CASES.md).

Check or manage the installation with `omh`:

```sh
omh doctor
omh list
omh runtime status
omh state status
omh update
```

Installer options:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_AUTO_APPLY=0 sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes-agent/main/install.sh | OMH_CHANNEL=stable OMH_VERSION=0.1.0 sh

## Mental Model

Hermes remains the agent runtime.

`omh` adds six things around it:

1. A managed skill directory at `~/.omh/skills`
2. A manifest at `~/.omh/manifest.json`
3. Local runtime artifacts under `~/.omh/runtime`
4. A config registration in Hermes' `skills.external_dirs`
5. Hermes-facing planning artifacts under `~/.hermes/plans`
6. Platform-neutral chat contracts for Discord, Slack, and hosted wrappers

That means installation is reversible and inspectable. `omh apply` updates only
the Hermes skill discovery setting. It does not rewrite workspace instructions
or modify Hermes internals.

## What Gets Recorded

`omh` records runtime metadata only by default:

- install/apply/doctor summaries in `~/.omh/runtime/state.json`
- workflow run envelopes in `~/.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/run.json`
- append-only run events in `events.jsonl`
- wrapper chat sessions in `~/.omh/runtime/wrapper_sessions/<session-id>/`
- delegation observation in `delegation.json`
- prepared coding handoffs in `coding_delegation.json`
- wrapper observation in `wrapper.json`

Hermes-facing plans are separate user-facing Markdown artifacts under
`~/.hermes/plans`. They intentionally include the task statement so Hermes and
the user can inspect the plan subject. They do not store raw platform event JSON
or claim review/execution evidence by default.

Wrapper-native chat interactions are stdout contracts. `omh chat interact`
returns a `chat_interaction/v1` envelope with a renderable
`chat_response/v1` object, platform-neutral actions, a stable `thread_key`, and
an `overclaim_guard`. It does not store raw prompt bodies by default and does
not require the user in Discord or Slack to know any `omh` command names.

Coding delegation artifacts separate a prepared executor handoff from observed
execution. `omh coding delegate --record` stores the recommended workflow,
harness, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, source references,
recommendation evidence, `message_sha256`, `message_length`, and status
`prepared_not_observed`; it does not store the raw prompt body by default. Its
companion `run.json` is bookkeeping for that prepared handoff and is marked
`status: prepared`,
`artifact_kind: prepared_coding_delegation`, `phase: prepared`, and
`observation_status: prepared_not_observed`.

For delegation-first coding flows, wrappers can request an explicit Codex
handoff without asking `omh` to execute Codex:

```sh
omh coding delegate --executor codex --source discord --record "risky refactor"
```

The stdout and runtime record include a `coding_executor_handoff/v1` instruction
payload with executor target `codex`, acceptance criteria, verification
expectations, review expectations, and status `prepared_not_observed`. The raw
message remains a `{message}` placeholder in templates unless
`--include-message` is used for stdout-only wrapper dispatch.

Delegation artifacts separate `requested` from `observed`. If Hermes or a bot
wrapper cannot prove that a specialist lane actually ran, the result should stay
`not_observed` or `not_available`.

Bot wrappers can also record what they actually observed:

```sh
omh runtime wrapper --run <run-id> --prompt-dispatched --response-observed --completion-status completed
omh runtime validate --run <run-id>
omh runtime export --redacted
```

To turn recorded evidence into a safe user-facing status, wrappers can ask for a
deterministic summary:

```sh
omh runtime delegation-status --run <run-id>
```

The summary reports prepared handoff, executor observation, verification
observation, review readiness, a `next_action`, and an `overclaim_guard`.
Prepared handoff is never treated as implementation, review, CI, or merge
evidence by itself.

For Codex-oriented coding work, wrappers can use a higher-level lifecycle
helper instead of stitching together runtime commands by hand:

```sh
omh coding lifecycle start --executor codex --record "risky refactor"
omh coding lifecycle dispatch --run <run-id>
omh coding lifecycle result --run <run-id> --result completed
omh coding lifecycle verify --run <run-id> --completion-status completed
omh coding lifecycle report --run <run-id>
```

The lifecycle helper still writes the same local runtime artifacts. It derives
status from prepared handoff, dispatch observation, executor result,
verification, and review readiness; it does not mutate the prepared run envelope
into proof of execution.

## Routing Model

The `oh-my-hermes` skill is the top-level router.

It is prompt-level guidance, not a hidden runtime hook. When Hermes exposes
installed skill descriptions to the model, the router gives Hermes a clear
registry of workflow names, strong trigger phrases, conservative fallback rules,
and recovery steps.

Routing priority:

1. Explicit slash skill invocation wins.
2. Strong workflow keywords route to the matching installed skill.
3. Broad planning requests route to `ralplan` or `plan` before implementation.
4. Finish-until-done requests route to `ralph` only after scope is concrete.
5. Unknown or conflicting signals stay in `oh-my-hermes` and ask one concise
   clarification question.

A bare common word such as `team`, `ask`, `wiki`, or `review` is not enough when
it could mean normal conversation.

The primary wrapper API is `omh chat interact`. A Discord, Slack, or hosted
Hermes adapter passes either a plain message or a platform event JSON payload and
receives one `chat_interaction/v1` envelope. The nested `chat_response/v1`
contains the user-facing headline, body, state, and platform-neutral actions
such as `accept_plan`, `revise_plan`, `send_to_codex`, `show_status`, or
`cancel`. Action labels do not expose `omh`, argv arrays, or shell command text.

Wrappers that need restart recovery can use `omh chat session`. A session is a
metadata-only chat decision/index record keyed by `thread_key` and
`session_id`. It records plan accepted, revision requested, cancelled, and
handoff prepared decisions. It links to `current_run_id` after a Codex handoff is
prepared, but execution, review, CI, and merge evidence remain owned by the
linked runtime run ledger.

`omh chat interact` composes existing deterministic primitives instead of
replacing them. Route-shaped turns use `omh chat route` semantics. Planning
turns use `hermes_plan/v1` and the existing `wrapper_contract` bridge.
Implementation-shaped turns can prepare a `coding_delegation/v1` payload and a
Codex-only `coding_executor_handoff/v1` when the route is safe to delegate.
Status turns wrap `delegated_coding_status/v1` into chat copy that separates
prepared, dispatched, executed, reviewed, verified, CI, and merged evidence.

The lower-level commands remain useful for debugging, tests, and custom
adapters:

- `omh chat route` returns only the deterministic route decision.
- `omh chat session` persists wrapper plan decisions and links accepted plans to prepared Codex handoff runs.
- `omh hermes plan` writes Hermes-facing plan Markdown under `.hermes/plans/`.
- `omh coding delegate` prepares a coding handoff without tracking lifecycle.
- `omh coding lifecycle` records and reports the Codex handoff lifecycle.

The generated skill catalog also classifies each adapted workflow by role.
Hermes-retained lanes such as `web-research`, `deep-interview`, `plan`, and
`ralplan` stay focused on source gathering, clarification, planning, status, and
evidence narration. Coding-heavy compatibility lanes such as `ultragoal`,
`ultrawork`, and cleanup workflows remain installed, but their generated
handoff policy tells wrappers to prepare and track Codex work instead of
implying Hermes performed hidden implementation. This classification is
deterministic advisory metadata for generated skills and wrapper UX; it does not
by itself enforce runtime routing or mutate Hermes core behavior.

Actual Discord and Slack transports stay outside this repository. `omh` does
not open network connections, authenticate bots, post messages, invoke Codex, or
patch Hermes internals.

The important design choice is that routing data lives in
`src/skills/catalog.py` and rendered skill text lives in
`src/skills/render.py`. This keeps the workflow registry testable as data
instead of burying routing behavior in one long string.

## Safety

- Existing managed files are protected by `~/.omh/manifest.json`.
- Local modifications are not overwritten unless `--force` is supplied.
- `omh apply --dry-run` shows config changes without writing.
- `omh uninstall` removes config registration first; file deletion requires
  `--remove-files`.
- Tests use temporary homes and do not mutate the real `~/.hermes`.

## Development

Install the current checkout in editable mode:

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run the test suite:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m compileall src
```

Smoke-test the installer without touching real home directories:

```sh
python -m omh.cli --omh-home /tmp/omh-smoke --hermes-home /tmp/hermes-smoke install --dry-run
```

## Roadmap

- Versioned release artifacts for stable installer targets
- A richer generated routing registry
- More artifact-backed bot and workflow examples
- More Hermes-specific diagnostics in `omh doctor`
- Command-level tests for uninstall, snippet output, and imported skill edge cases
- Workflow fixtures that verify generated skill behavior remains conservative
