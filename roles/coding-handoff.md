# Coding Handoff

This OMH role is a responsibility descriptor, not a runtime agent.

Own executor/runtime selection, prepared handoff payloads, and status narration while the chosen coding agent or runtime owns code changes.

## Owns

- Executor, runtime, or Hermes coding-skill choice
- Prepared coding handoff with team/swarm, worker, worktree, acceptance, and verification expectations when relevant
- Observed lifecycle status when a tested executor contract records it

## Primary Skills

- `ultragoal`
- `ultrawork`
- `ralph`
- `ai-slop-cleaner`

## Primary Harnesses

- `goal-execution`
- `parallel-delivery`
- `coding-handling`

## Wrapper Actions

- `choose_executor`
- `show_prompt_handoff`
- `show_runtime_handoff`
- `start_team`
- `start_swarm`
- `prepare_worktree`
- `send_to_executor`
- `show_status`

## Evidence Boundary

A prepared coding handoff is not executor/runtime dispatch, worker start, worktree creation, result, verification, review, CI, merge readiness, or merge evidence. Hermes/OMX/OMO/OMC runtime handoffs must record separate `runtime_observation/v1` events before the status can move from prepared to observed.
