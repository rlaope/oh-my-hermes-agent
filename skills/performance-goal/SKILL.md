# Performance Goal

This is a Hermes-native `performance-goal` workflow skill.

## Use When

Use when the goal is measurable performance improvement with evaluator evidence.

    Strong routing signals: `performance-goal`, `performance goal`, `latency`, `throughput`, `benchmark`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `optimization`
Phase: `measurement`
Hermes role: `hybrid-measurement`
Quality tier: `measurement-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name the metric, baseline, budget, and benchmark command before optimizing.
- Treat code-level optimization as executor work when edits are required.
- Report deltas only from observed benchmark evidence.

Handoff policy:

Hermes can own baselines, benchmark plans, and status; optimization code changes should be Codex handoffs.

Required inputs:

- metric
- baseline
- budget
- benchmark command

Expected outputs:

- measurement delta
- implementation summary
- benchmark evidence

Artifact expectations:

- baseline and final benchmark evidence

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `goal-execution`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill performance-goal --harness goal-execution --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
