# Ai Slop Cleaner

This is a Hermes-native `ai-slop-cleaner` workflow skill.

## Use When

Use for behavior-preserving cleanup with tests before and after edits.

    Strong routing signals: `ai-slop-cleaner`, `$ai-slop-cleaner`, `cleanup`, `deslop`, `refactor`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `maintenance`
Phase: `cleanup`
Hermes role: `codex-handoff-guidance`
Quality tier: `regression-gated`

Quality bar:

- Lock current behavior with regression checks before non-trivial cleanup.
- Prefer deletion, reuse, and boundary repair over new abstractions.
- Rerun verification after cleanup before claiming behavior is preserved.

Handoff policy:

Use Hermes to define cleanup scope and regression checks; delegate behavior-preserving edits to Codex once tests are clear.

Required inputs:

- target smell
- current behavior
- regression checks

Expected outputs:

- small cleanup diff
- before/after verification
- residual risk

Artifact expectations:

- cleanup plan and regression evidence for non-trivial work

Safety rules:

- Lock behavior with tests before risky cleanup.
- Prefer deletion and existing utilities over new layers.
- Do not add dependencies for cleanup unless explicitly requested.

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill ai-slop-cleaner --harness coding-handling --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
