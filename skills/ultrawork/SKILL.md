# Ultrawork

This is a Hermes-native `ultrawork` workflow skill.

## Use When

Use when an accepted implementation plan can be split into independent, reviewable work lanes.

    Strong routing signals: `ultrawork`, `$ultrawork`, `parallel work`, `parallel implementation`, `high throughput`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `execution`
Phase: `parallel-delivery`
Hermes role: `codex-handoff-guidance`
Quality tier: `handoff-gated`

Quality bar:

- Require disjoint lane ownership before preparing multiple coding handoffs.
- Attach acceptance criteria, verification commands, and review expectations to each lane.
- Keep dispatch, execution, review, CI, and merge status evidence separate.

Handoff policy:

Keep the workflow name for compatibility, but convert coding lanes into explicit selected executor handoffs with disjoint scope, verification, and review evidence.

Required inputs:

- accepted plan
- lane list
- disjoint file or responsibility scopes
- verification commands

Expected outputs:

- executor handoff prompts or lane instructions
- status summary
- review/CI evidence requirements

Artifact expectations:

- prepared coding delegation record per implementation lane when wrappers can record them

Safety rules:

- Do not start parallel coding without disjoint ownership boundaries.
- Keep Hermes responsible for orchestration/status, not hidden implementation.
- Record unobserved executor work as prepared_not_observed or not_observed.

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `goal-execution`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill ultrawork --harness goal-execution --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1` when a wrapper reports it: bind state to the current target/thread, adapt only the parts of this workflow that benefit from multiple Hermes agents, and fall back to single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one.
- When target topology changes from one to many or many to one, give a concise setup-change comment or use the wrapper's apply action before treating the new topology as persistent.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers or explicit checklists,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
